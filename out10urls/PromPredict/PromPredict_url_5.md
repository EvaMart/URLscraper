**_(Web server for promoter identification in genomic DNA sequence )_**
PromPredict is a web-based tool to identify promoter regions in genomic DNA sequence, based on difference in stability between neighboring regions.**
** Paste the sequence in FASTA format  **Example Sequence
**or upload the sequence file **  
**%GC content to be used for prediction:   
Sequence %GC  Whole genome %GC  ** HELP  
**Specify the window size to be used:  100 nt ** ****50 nt ** HELP
** Search in transcription direction only Both directions
