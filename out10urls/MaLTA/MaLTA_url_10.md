You are hereSoftware / SimReg
A Simulated Regression based algorithm for transcriptome quantification.
SimReg is a standalone tool that requires gcc 4.0 or greater, and runs on Linux.
1\. Boost (http://www.boost.org) version 1.38 or higher,
2\. CVXOPT: A Python Package for Convex Optimization: http://openopt.org/CVXOPT
3\. TCLAP library: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tclap/
To run SimReg simply use the following command: $PWD/run-mcreg.sh 
(always use full path to run-mcreg.sh)
First you will need to compile all source files using the make command.
(The C++ source files have been compiled on Ubuntu server so the program may work as is. See README.txt, inside the testbech directory, for testing instructions )
