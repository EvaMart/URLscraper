# Welcome to your new Drupal website!
Please follow these steps to set up and start using your website:
1. **Configure your website** Once logged in, visit the administration section, where you can customize and configure all aspects of your website.
2. **Enable additional functionality** Next, visit the module list and enable features which suit your specific needs. You can find additional modules in the Drupal modules download section.
3. **Customize your website design** To change the "look and feel" of your website, visit the themes section. You may choose from one of the included themes or download additional themes from the Drupal themes download section.
4. **Start posting content** Finally, you can create content for your website. This message will disappear once you have promoted a post to the front page.
For more information, please refer to the help section, or the online Drupal handbooks. You may also post at the Drupal forum, or view the wide range of other support options available.
