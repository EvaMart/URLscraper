**ViSpA : Viral Spectrum Assembler **
_ViSpA_ implements a novel viral assembling and frequency estimation methods. This software uses a simple error correction, viral variants assembling based on maximum-bandwidth paths in weighted read graphs and frequency estimation via Expectation Maximization on all reads. Experiments show that _ViSpA _is better in quasispecies assembling than the state-of-the-art method of ShoRAH.
The software is written in Java, EM part is written in python, wrapper script is written in bash scripting language.
_ViSpA_ can be downloaded here (vispa02.zip). See the readme.txt file for installation instructions.
