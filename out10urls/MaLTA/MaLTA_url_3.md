MaLTA is a method for simultaneous transcriptome assembly and quantification from Ion Torrent RNA-Seq data. Our approach explores transcriptome structure and incorporates maximum likelihood model into assembly and quantification procedure. New version of IsoEM algorithm suitable for Ion Torrent RNA-Seq reads is used to accurately estimate transcript expression levels. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that Ion Torrent RNA-Seq data can be successfully used for transcriptome analyses. Experimental results suggest increased transcriptome assembly and quantification accuracy of MaLTA-IsoEM solution compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. For details see out BMC Genomics paper.
The open source C++ implementation of MaLTA is freely available for download.
