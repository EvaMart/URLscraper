## Transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis for RNA-Seq.
# Cuffdiff performance assessments
# Cuffdiff performance assessments
Cuffdiff is a robust tool for differential analysis of RNA-Seq experiments. It performs as well as or better than other commonly used tools over a large range of RNA-Seq experimental designs. Here, we provide up-to-date performance data to show that the current release performs at or exceeds the standards described in the Cuffdiff 2 manuscript. The experiments here include both simulated and real data.
**PLEASE NOTE:** The data presented here are **not intended to provide a comprehensive evaluation of Cuffdiff’s performance**. These experiments are part of a testing suite we use to make sure that changes made between versions work as expected, and do not hurt performance or cause other problems. While the simulation experiments reflect a wide range of experimental scenarios that we commonly encounter when performing RNA-Seq, there may be use cases not captured here.
In Trapnell and Hendrickson et al, we analyzed several real RNA-Seq datasets and compared them with matched data from other expression measurement technologies. These comparisons showed that Cuffdiff 2 is robust and accurate. The studies below include a re-analysis of those datasets.
* HOXA1 knockdown in fibroblasts
* Griffith et al
The simulations studies presented below assess Cuffdiff’s performance under various hypothetical experimental scenarios. They are all intended to be “realistic”, in the sense that users may encounter these experimental settings during routine RNA-Seq analysis. We have performed extensive sequencing using our in-house RNA-Seq read simulator, TuxSim.
Most of the simulations are designed around the fibroblast control data presented in Trapnell and Hendrickson et al. That is, the number of replicates, sequencing depth, cross-replicate variability, and other properties have be set to match the real experiment in the paper. Except where otherwise noted, the experiments are designed as follows:
UCSC protein coding genes
Experimental base data set
Trapnell and Hendrickson et al Lung fibroblast
~15,000,000 fragments per replicate
Most abundant of each gene
Number of genes perturbed
Minimum depth for gene perturbation
You can find the results for each simulation in the sections listed. The “basic” simulation covers what we feel will be a representative experiment for many users performing in-vitro studies (e.g. knockdowns, overexpression, drug treatment in a dish, etc). It includes a full report of Cuffdiff’s accuracy. Some simulations do not show results to the same level of detail as the “basic” simulation, because the results are largely the same as that setting. We thus exclude some panels for brevity.
