HMM-FRAME is designed to accurately locate and correct frameshift errors in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data using an augmented Viterbi algorithm on profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs). By correcting the frameshift errors, it can classify more NGS sequences into their native protein domain families.
