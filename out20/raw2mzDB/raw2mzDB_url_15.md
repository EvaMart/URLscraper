Organize your issues with project boards
Did you know you can manage projects in the same place you keep your code? Set up a project board on GitHub to streamline and automate your workflow.
Add issues and pull requests to your board and prioritize them alongside note cards containing ideas or task lists.
Sort tasks into columns by status. You can label columns with status indicators like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
Set up triggering events to save time on project management—we’ll move tasks into the right columns for you.
Keep track of everything happening in your project and see exactly what’s changed since the last time you looked.
Each card has a unique URL, making it easy to share and discuss individual tasks with your team.
After you wrap up your work, close your project board to remove it from your active projects list. On to the next project!
