ANGSD: Analysis of next generation Sequencing Data
Latest tar.gz version is (0.930/0.931 on github), see Change_log for changes, and download it  here.
# HWE and Inbreeding estimates
Jump to: navigation, search
# Site estimate of inbreeding coefficient (HWE test)
By choosing **HWE_pval_F 1**, no sites will be filtered but the p-value along with the frequency, and F for the sites will be dumped in **.hweF.gz** file.
# Estimation of individual inbreeding coefficients
Filipe G. Vieira has been extending the ANGSD feature set by a very fancy method for estimating individual inbreeding coefficients. Please see his website here: https://github.com/fgvieira/ngsF for the latest version which is utilising ANGSD output
