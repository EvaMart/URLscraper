_EMBL-EBI_ provides programmatic access to various data resources and analysis tools via Web Services technologies  1) 2).
Web Services is an integration and inter-operation technology. To ensure client and server software from various sources will work well together, the technology is built on open standards:
* Representational state transfer (REST): a software architecture style.
* Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): a messaging protocol for transporting information.
* Web Services Description Language (WSDL): a method for describing Web Services and their capabilities.
For the transport layer Web Services utilise common network protocols, typically the  _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_ (HTTP) used to provide access to web sites.
